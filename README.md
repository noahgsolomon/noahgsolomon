- 👋 Hi, I’m Noah Solomon! I am 19 living in Atlanta GA studying Computer Science at Kennesaw State University.

- 👀 I’m interested in Computer Science, Marketing, and Psychology. I like to challenge myself as much as possible. Ways I
        have challenged myself and look to continue is by creating and selling out my NFT project "Antoon's World"
        (https://opensea.io/collection/antoons-world), read one book a week, constantly working on new projects, and by
        learning as much as possible outside of school. My passion is learning and growing and there is no way to constantly
        learn if you only have one temporary vessel of information. 
        
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Computer Science (I love everything data, game creation, and algorithms), Marketing, and Psychology
        
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that interests me that I can find. 

- 📫 I am available at noahsolomon2003@gmail.com for any inquiries
