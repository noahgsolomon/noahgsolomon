- 👋 Hi, I’m Noah Solomon! I am 19 living in Atlanta GA studying Computer Science at Kennesaw State University.

- 👀 I’m interested in Computer Science, Marketing, and Psychology. I like to challenge myself as much as possible. Ways I
        have challenged myself are through creating and selling out my NFT project "Antoon's World"
        (https://opensea.io/collection/antoons-world), creating and growing a group of people who read one book per week with me,
        working on new projects, and by learning as much as possible outside of school. My passion is learning and growing and there
        is no way to constantly learn/grow if you only have one temporary vessel in which you get information from. 
        
- 🌱 I’m currently studying Computer Science (I love everything data, game creation, and algorithms), Marketing, and Psychology
        
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that interests me. 

- 📫 I am available at noahsolomon2003@gmail.com for any inquiries
